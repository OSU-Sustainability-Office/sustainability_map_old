# OSU Sustainability Map
**The map can be accessed [here](http://carbon.campusops.oregonstate.edu/map/).**

This project aims to replace an aging sustainability map housed on the [Sustainability Office's "Food" page](http://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/operations/food). The new map will add new features, and will provide a more engaging map experience using Google Maps JavaScript API.


 - V1.0.0 was completed on 1/8/2018 by Jack Woods, and implemented a basic map with toggle-able layers and custom branding.
