# OSU Sustainability Map
**The map can be accessed [here](http://carbon.campusops.oregonstate.edu/map/).**

This project aims to replace an aging sustainability map housed on the [Sustainability Office's "Food" page](http://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/operations/food). The new map will add new features, and will provide a more engaging map experience using Google Maps JavaScript API.

**As of a meeting on 3/27, the focus of the sustainability map is changing.**
It will work similar to the [Corvallis Bus App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=osu.appclub.corvallisbus) by:
  - Focusing on simplicity and interactivity,
  - Abstracting the user from non-relevant data until it "becomes" relevant through interactions,
  - Allowing a user to search for a point, then tapping that point to see more data.
  
Data will be provided to software developers by Anthropology students in ".csv" format.

Other notable features will include:
 - URLs corresponding to various search terms (similar to google search). This is how default data will be set.
 - New icons/logos.
